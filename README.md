In a basic Lambda function, you don't necessarily need to use the event and context parameters in your code. However, these parameters are available and can provide useful information depending on your use case.

The event parameter contains data about the triggering event that caused the Lambda function to execute. The structure and content of the event object depend on the event source that triggers the Lambda function. For example, if your Lambda function is triggered by an S3 bucket upload, the event object will contain details about the uploaded file, such as the bucket name, object key, and other relevant information.

The context parameter provides information about the runtime environment and AWS resources. It includes properties and methods that you can use within your Lambda function. Some commonly used properties and methods of the context object are:

    context.aws_request_id: A unique identifier for the current invocation of the Lambda function.
    context.function_name: The name of the Lambda function.
    context.function_version: The version of the Lambda function.
    context.invoked_function_arn: The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the Lambda function.
    context.get_remaining_time_in_millis(): Returns the number of milliseconds left before the execution times out.

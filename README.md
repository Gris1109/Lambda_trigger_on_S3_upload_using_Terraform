In a basic Lambda function, you don't necessarily need to use the event and context parameters in your code. However, these parameters are available and can provide useful information depending on your use case.

The event parameter contains data about the triggering event that caused the Lambda function to execute. The structure and content of the event object depend on the event source that triggers the Lambda function. For example, if your Lambda function is triggered by an S3 bucket upload, the event object will contain details about the uploaded file, such as the bucket name, object key, and other relevant information.

The context parameter provides information about the runtime environment and AWS resources. It includes properties and methods that you can use within your Lambda function. Some commonly used properties and methods of the context object are:

    context.aws_request_id: A unique identifier for the current invocation of the Lambda function.
    context.function_name: The name of the Lambda function.
    context.function_version: The version of the Lambda function.
    context.invoked_function_arn: The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the Lambda function.
    context.get_remaining_time_in_millis(): Returns the number of milliseconds left before the execution times out.

# Lambda Trigger on S3 Upload using Terraform

This project demonstrates how to trigger a Lambda function when an S3 bucket receives an upload, using Terraform.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account
- Terraform installed
- Proper AWS permissions

## Project Structure

Explain the structure of your project, highlighting important directories and files. Mention the key Terraform files that users need to be aware of:

    terraform/ directory: Contains the Terraform configuration files.
    resources.tf: Defines the Terraform resources required for the project.
    outputs.tf: Specifies the outputs that users can access after provisioning the infrastructure.
    variables.tf (optional): Lists the input variables that can be customized by users.

## Resources

Provide a summary of the main resources provisioned by the Terraform configuration. Describe each resource briefly, including its purpose and any relevant configuration details.

    Example:
        AWS S3 Bucket: Creates an S3 bucket for storing user uploads. It is named example-bucket and has private access control.

## Outputs

Explain the important outputs that users can access after the infrastructure is provisioned. Describe the purpose of each output and how users can utilize them.

    Example:
        bucket_name: The name of the created S3 bucket (example-bucket). Users can reference this output in other parts of their project.
        lambda_function_arn: The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the deployed Lambda function. Users can use this ARN to integrate the function with other AWS services.

## Variables

If you have a variables.tf file defining input variables, provide an overview of these variables and explain how users can customize them. Include the purpose of each variable and any default values or restrictions.

    Example:
        bucket_name (optional): Allows users to specify a custom name for the S3 bucket. Defaults to example-bucket.


## Getting Started

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to get started with your project, including:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Lambda_trigger_on_S3_upload_using_Terraform.git
   cd Lambda_trigger_on_S3_upload_using_Terraform

2. Configure AWS credentials:

    Create an AWS access key and secret key.
    Configure the AWS CLI with your credentials.

3. Edit configuration files:

    Provide details on which files need to be edited and how to configure them for your specific project.
    Include information on any variables or parameters that need to be set.

4. Deploy the infrastructure:

    Explain how to use Terraform to deploy the infrastructure.
    Include the necessary Terraform commands, such as terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply.
    Provide any additional instructions specific to your project, such as setting up remote state or using Terraform workspaces.

## Usage

Explain how to use your project once the infrastructure is deployed. This may include:

    How to access and use the deployed resources (e.g., URLs, endpoints, credentials)
    Instructions for interacting with the infrastructure (e.g., executing API calls, running tests)

Examples

Provide examples or use cases that demonstrate the usage of your project. Include step-by-step instructions and code snippets to guide users through specific scenarios.
